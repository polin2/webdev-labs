## Reflection Document

### HTML

- For the HTML exercises, I heavily relied on the videos and solutions for help. I did attempt some on my own, but then watched all the videos and followed along/modified my code.

- I haven't looked at homework 1 yet, but in general, I found these exercises to be very helpful. I liked the first exercise as it felt the easiest to grasp. It felt easily doable after the lecture content on lists.

- Everything was explained well. There was a lot of content covered, but I can't think of anything I wish was explained better.

- I think it would've been nice if there was an easier form exercise - either in addition to this one or instead, do it because this one felt like jumping into the deep end.

### Accessibility

- For the Accessibility exercises, I did a combination of using my lecture notes to try it out first, and then following along with the video.

- I found all the exercises to be quite helpful, and I found I looked back on them when doing my homework assignment.

- I found the lectures and readings for accessibility to be comprehensive and thorough.

- There are no additional exercises that I can think of to cover the content better.

### CSS

- For the CSS exercises, I did a follow-along style with the videos, where I coded while following along with the videos and pausing to try things out as needed.

- I found the exercises to be very helpful and in direct correlation with what the lectures covered. I found the positioning exercise to be particularly helpful because I feel like I didn't quite grasp the concept from the lecture alone.

- Everything was explained well and thoroughly.

- At the moment, I cannot think of any other exercises that might have helped me learn CSS better.
