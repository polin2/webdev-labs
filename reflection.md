## Reflection Document

### HTML
- For the HTML exercises, I heavily relied on the videos and solutions
  for help. I did attempt some on my own, but then watched all the
  videos and followed along/modified my code.

- I haven't looked at homework 1 yet, but in general, I found these exercises to be very helpful. I liked the first exercise as it felt the easiest to grasp.

- It felt easily doable after the lecture content on lists. Everything
  was explained well. There was a lot of content covered, but I can't
  think of anything I wish as explained better.

- I think it would've been nice if there was an easier form exercise - either in addition to this one or instead, do it because this one felt like jumping into the deep end.
